Core user flows (what users see & do)
Landing & Invite

Landing page with product value props, sample screenshots, “Request Invite” or “Sign up”.

Invite codes or email allowlist for exclusivity.

Sign-up / Authentication

Email + password, or OAuth (GitHub / Google / Discord).

Email verification and optional 2FA (TOTP).

Optional “Persona” selection during onboarding (Casual, Expert, Creative, Developer).

Onboarding

Quick product tour: show Humanizer slider, Detector toggle, Mode selection, privacy settings.

Create first “workspace” (personal or team) and pick usage limits / billing plan.

Main Dashboard

Left nav: Home (chat), History, Modes, Prompts Library, Team, Billing, Settings.

Central area: chat / conversation pane with message stream, persona badge, and humanizer & detector overlays.

Right pane (collapsible): Detector output (AI-probability, top giveaway words), Humanizer settings, system prompts.

Chat / Compose UI

Message composer with quick mode selector (Logic, Creative, Expert, Fast), humanizer slider (0–100), and “Run Detector” button.

After each message generation, the Detector displays: percentage AI-likelihood, top 5 giveaway tokens/phrases, and short remediation tips.

“Regenerate (Humanize more)” button to re-run with higher humanization intensity.

Prompts Library & ModeFusion

Save prompts, share with team, tag them (e.g., marketing, code, story).

ModeFusion: pick up to 3 cores to combine (e.g., LogicCore + Creative).

History & Export

Searchable conversation history, export to PDF/MD, redact sensitive items.

Admin / Team

Invite teammates, control roles and workspace API keys, usage quotas, and audit logs.

Key product features (high level)
Multiple AI Modes: toggle between Core modes (Logic, Creative, Expert, Fast) and combine modes with ModeFusion.

AI Humanizer: slider that post-processes model output to reduce “AIiness” (see below).

AI Detector (DeepTrace): returns a % AI-likelihood, highlights “giveaway words/phrases”, and explains why each token increased the score.

Transparency Panel: shows which modes were used, exact prompt sent to the LLM, and a short “humanizer diff” summary.

Prompts & Templates: marketplace-style library for saved prompt patterns.

Privacy Controls: redaction, workspace retention rules, export, GDPR-friendly data deletion.

Rate limits & Billing: per-user quotas and pay-as-you-go model for heavy API calls.

The AI Humanizer (how it works)
Purpose: reduce common machine-like patterns while preserving meaning.

Components:

Style Transformer (post-processor):

Takes LLM output and rewrites for human-like variation: sentence length variance, idiom insertion, filler words (optionally), controlled colloquialism, and subtle punctuation changes.

Uses parametric templates controlled by the Humanizer slider (0 = raw, 100 = max humanized).

Error Injection Module (optional & configurable):

Adds benign, realistic “imperfections” (contractions, minor colloquial grammar shifts) when enabled.

Diversity Engine:

Synonym substitution and rare-phrase injection to avoid repetition.

Safety Filter:

Ensures humanization does not introduce false facts, slurs, or remove required disclaimers.

Humanizer Audit:

Shows a “diff” between original output and humanized output with the key transformations annotated.

Implementation notes:

Implement as a middleware microservice that receives model output, applies deterministic rules + small rewrite LLM (or smaller local transformer) for stylistic changes.

Keep this service stateless for scale; configuration lives in user profile.

Provide a revert option to show original LLM text.

The AI Detector (DeepTrace) — how it works
Purpose: estimate how likely a piece of text is AI-generated and identify giveaway words.

Components:

Classifier Model

A fine-tuned transformer classifier trained on mixed corpora: human writing (forums, blogs, emails) vs. LLM outputs (various models & temperatures).

Outputs a calibrated probability (0–100%).

Explainability Layer

Uses SHAP/LIME-like token attribution or attention-based scoring to rank tokens/phrases that most increased the AI score.

Returns top K giveaway tokens with short reasons (e.g., “overuse of formal transition”, “high lexical uniformity”).

Calibration & Confidence

Shows confidence intervals; warns if classifier is uncertain (e.g., short text).

UI Integration

Inline highlights in the chat stream and a right-hand Detector panel listing percent + giveaway words + remedial suggestions (e.g., “use contractions”, “reduce formality”).

Privacy

Detector runs locally on your server (optional) or via secure API; highlight words are derived locally and not sent to analytics unless user opts in.

Implementation note:

Ship with thresholds that map to actions: under 20% = human-like; 20–60% = likely mixed; >60% = likely AI.

Allow users to adjust detector sensitivity.

Architecture & tech stack (recommended)
Frontend

React (Next.js for SSR) or Remix

Tailwind CSS for UI

React Query / SWR for data fetching

Headless UI / Radix for accessible components

Backend

Node.js (NestJS or Express) or Python (FastAPI)

Auth: OAuth + JWT, TOTP for 2FA

API gateway / BFF pattern: a thin backend-for-frontend to orchestrate calls

Microservices for: LLM Orchestrator, Humanizer, Detector, Worker Queue

Datastores

PostgreSQL for transactional data (users, prompts, billing)

Redis for caching, rate-limiting, and session store

Vector DB (Pinecone / Milvus / Weaviate) for context / retrieval augmentation

Object storage (S3) for exports & assets

LLM & models

Primary LLMs via API (OpenAI, Anthropic) or self-hosted Llama-style models (if infra allows).

Small local models for Humanizer and Detector (or distilled versions to save cost).

Orchestration layer that routes requests: LogicCore → model-A, CreativeMind → model-B, ModeFusion → parallel calls + aggregator.

Infrastructure

Containerized with Docker; orchestrate in Kubernetes (EKS/GKE) or use managed containers (Fly.io / Render / Vercel for frontend + serverless functions).

CI/CD: GitHub Actions / GitLab CI.

Obs/Monitoring: Prometheus + Grafana; Sentry for errors; Datadog for tracing.

Scaling

Autoscale stateless services with horizontal pods.

Place humanizer/detector as separate services so you can scale them independently from the LLM usage.

Data flow (simple)
User composes prompt + picks modes + humanizer level.

Frontend sends request to BFF (backend-for-frontend).

BFF:

Logs request, checks quota.

Sends prompt to LLM Orchestrator (routes to chosen model(s)).

LLM Orchestrator returns raw output.

Output goes to Humanizer service (if enabled).

Final text is stored in conversation log.

Detector service runs (unless disabled) on final text and returns score + highlights.

Frontend shows final output and detector panel.

API & Endpoints (examples)
POST /api/v1/auth/signup — create user

POST /api/v1/auth/login — login + JWT

POST /api/v1/chat/generate — send prompt, modes, humanizer level

GET /api/v1/chat/history — list conversations

POST /api/v1/detector/analyze — return AI% + giveaway tokens

POST /api/v1/humanizer/transform — returns humanized text + diff

POST /api/v1/prompts — save/load templates

UX & UI details (design language)
Dark, secret-lab aesthetic with neon accent (fits the “SECRET” brand).

Compose bar is large and command-palette style (press / to open quick actions).

Humanizer slider: immediate preview mode (small sample) and “Apply to full response”.

Detector panel: shows percentage badge, colored gauge (green/yellow/red), and inline token highlights.

Transparency modal: shows aggregated prompt (masked PII), modes used, and cost/latency estimate.

Security, privacy & compliance
Mandatory TLS everywhere.

Store hashed passwords (bcrypt / argon2), rotate keys, and support hardware 2FA for admins.

Tenant isolation: row-level policies in DB or separate DB per workspace for isolation.

User data export & deletion endpoints (GDPR).

Audit logs for admin actions.

Rate limits and anomaly detection to avoid abuse.

Option to disable logging of prompts (privacy mode) — useful for enterprise customers.

Observability & cost controls
Track tokens per request and show cost to user before long generations.

Enable usage caps per workspace with soft / hard limits.

Instrument telemetry for latency, error rate, and model cost per call.

Roadmap (first 90 days)
MVP (30d): Core chat, Mode selection, Humanizer (basic rules), Detector (simple classifier), sign-up, history.
